  "ingredients": [
    "1.5kg of Tomato",
    "1 1/2 tsp of Smoked Paprika",
    "2 of Garlic cloves",
    "1 (diced) of Onion",
    "1 L (4 cups) of Vegetable Stock"

  "steps": [
    "1. Place halved tomatoes and unpeeled garlic cloves on a baking tray. Toss with olive oil, smoked paprika, salt and pepper. Arrange them cut face up.",
    "2. Roast for 40 to 45 minutes in a hot oven until the surface has little charred bits and the tomatoes are completely soft.",
    "3. Sauté the onion and garlic in a little oil until the onion is soft and translucent.",
    "4. Add the tomatoes and vegetable stock.",
    "5. Squeeze the roasted garlic flesh from the skins. The garlic flavour will be very mellowed and sweet. (It's tempting to smear it on toast - in fact, it's a brilliant way to use it!).",
    "6. Blitz until smooth using a stick blender. Or do this step in a food processor or blender (you need a high powered blender like a Vitamin or Blendtec to make the soup perfectly smooth).",
    "7. Simmer for 10 minutes to bring the flavours together, then stir in the cream.",
    "8. Ladle into bowls and serve with a drizzle of cream and sprinkle of fresh basil!"
